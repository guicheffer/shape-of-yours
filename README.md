# Shape of YOURS
‚¨õÔ∏è‚≠ïÔ∏è Draws geometrical shapes based on user's action click

## Introduction

The goal of Shape of YOURS is to create a parallelogram with an inner circle on it.

- **Click in 3 different points inside the Shape of YOURS's squared board**, each click will generate a üî¥ and a number;
- After the 3 points appear on the squared board, an parallelogram will be shown and the inner circle will be added on it;
- **Move the dots** anytime you want to!
- **Informations** about your movement will be on the left;
- **Reset the board** to start again!
